This experiment tests the expression signature similarity of the sub-variants
of a particular gene.

Some genes are defined by a handful of hotspot mutations in cancer cohorts.
An archetype of this is BRAF, for which the V600E mutation is more frequent by
several orders of magnitude than any other particular BRAF mutation across the
TCGA cohorts. However, many genes exhibit the opposite kind of frequency
distribution for their variants.

For example, although TP53 is clearly a driver gene in tumourgenesis, it harbours
several mutations that qualify as hotspots and many others that are frequent enough
to warrant attention. Studies have shown that TP53 is highly pleiotropic, with its
mutations disrupting multiple downstream processes. However, it is unclear if the
characteristics of this disruption are uniform across its mutations, or if
particular mutations each account for one or more disruptive effects. Another
possibility is that mutations for genes such as TP53 cluster into sub-variants with
similar disruptive profiles. A likely clustering is along the form of the amino acid
alteration caused by the mutation, i.e. synonymous or non-synonymous, but manifold
other groupings are also possible, such as according to the exon where the mutation
is located, the particular protein it affects, etc.

We thus seek to identify the expression signature of not only the disruption caused
by the presence of a mutation in a given gene, but also the signature of its
sub-variants, if any such clusterings exist.
