# Example Mutations #

This directory contains mutation datasets designed for use in testing various HetMan components.
They also serve as examples of the kind of the format that HetMan expects input mutation datasets to be in.
See HetMan/data.py for methods of parsing raw mutation data from TCGA, ICGC, and other sources into this format.
Although some of these datasets were excerpted from real mutations, they are not meant to be used to draw any biologically relavant conclusions!


## muts_small ##

A simple set of mutations.


## muts_large ##

A larger set of mutations with multiple genes.


## muts_TP53 ##

A large set of mutations from a single gene (TP53).
